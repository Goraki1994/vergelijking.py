This is a readme.md file for learning how to use boleans.

In this simple "program" I created a varriable called age.  Which asks for user input to get it's integer value.
code snippet: age = int(input("What is your age?") 

The next line tells the program to print an output based on the user input. If the user tells us they are 18 years or older, then the program tells us that we are an adult

If not, the program tells us we are an adult.
code snippet:    if age >= 18:
                 print("Volwassen")
                 else:
                 print("Minderjarig"

I wrote this readme to visualize bolean concept to see if I actually understand why I wrote, what I wrote. And I hope that someone actually gets something out of it, CHEERS!
